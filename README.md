Only works on Linux (tested on Ubuntu 22.04). 

## How to run

Automatically deploy a bloodhound instance and populate it with the SharpHound data

positional arguments:
  {list,start,data,stop,delete}
                        Action to run
    list                List existing projects
    start               Create a new project or start an existing one
    data                Feed data into an existing project
    stop                Stop a running project (Not implemented yet)

You can edit the docker file in the template folder for more customization.
